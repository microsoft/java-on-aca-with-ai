# Build, Run and Monitor Intelligent Java Apps on Azure Container Apps and Azure OpenAI

## What you should expect

This is not the official documentation but an opinionated workshop.

It is a hands-on training, and it will use the command line extensively. The idea is to get coding very quickly and play with the platform, from a simple demo to far more complex examples.

After completing all the guides in [spring](spring) and [quarkus-micronaut](quarkus-micronaut), you should have a fairly good understanding of everything that Java on Azure Container Apps offers.

## [spring](spring)

This series of guides focus on building Java applications using **Spring** framwork and running them on Azure Container Apps. It also covers how to use Azure OpenAI to build AI applications.

## [quarkus-micronaut](quarkus-micronaut)

This series of guides focus on building Java applications using **Quarkus** and **Micronaut** frameworks and running them on Azure Container Apps. It also covers how to use Azure OpenAI to build AI applications.

For a third path that shows using Quarkus only, please see [link to the new repo](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/java-on-aca-quarkus).
